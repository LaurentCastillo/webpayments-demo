# Payment Apps
This folder contain a set of payment app implementations. Below is a short description of each of the apps. Navigating to any of these payment apps will not give you the payment flow, since there is no payment request available. Instead, you will be given the opportunity to register the payment app in your browser.

## [TommyPay](https://tommythorsen.github.io/webpayments-demo/payment-apps/tommypay/)
A very primitive test app. Instead of a realistic payment UX, it shows the raw payment request JSON.

## [Visa Checkout](https://tommythorsen.github.io/webpayments-demo/payment-apps/visa-checkout/)
This is a simple wrapper around the Visa Checkout sandbox as described [here](https://developer.visa.com/products/visa_checkout/guides).
